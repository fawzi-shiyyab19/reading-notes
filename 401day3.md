## The difference between Stack and Queue..
<pre>stack and queue both are non-primitive, linear data structures with so many differences in certain ways like mechanism,
structure,implementation and variants. But even though being different from one another,
they have a lot in common like storing the same data typeelements and with so many practical applications in real life. </pre>

### What is stack?
Stack is a linear data structure that follows the specific order to perform the operations. 

### What is Queue?
The queue is a linear data structure in which we can insert the element from one side of the list and delete the element from the other side of the list.

| Stack | Queue |
| --- | ----------- |
| The stack is based on LIFO(Last In First Out) principle| The queue is based on FIFO(First In First Out) principle.|
| Insertion Operation is called Push Operation|Insertion Operation is called Enqueue Operation|
| Deletion Operation is called Pop Operation|Deletion Operation is called Dequeue Operation|
|Push and Pop Operation takes place from one end of the stack|Enqueue and Dequeue Operation takes place from a different end of the queue|
|The most accessible element is called Top and the least accessible is called the Bottom of the stack|The insertion end is called Rear End and the deletion end is called the Front End.|
|Simple Implementation 	|	Complex implementation in comparison to stack|
|Only one pointer is used for performing operations |Two pointers are used to perform operations|
|There are no variants available for stack|There are three types of variants i.e circular queue, double-ended queue and priority queue|
|Can be considered as a vertical collection visual|Can be considered as a horizontal collection  visual|
|Used to solve the recursive type problems|Used to solve the problem having sequential processing|

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

<ul>
  <li>stacks.</li>
  <li>queues.</li>
  <li>event loop.</li>
</ul>

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
<ul>
  <li>what is the sync and async operations.</li>
  <li>event loop </li>
  <li>webApi functions</li>
</ul>

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
knows how single thread language works with these.
