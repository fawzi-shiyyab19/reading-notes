# Hash table

## In a hash table, a new index is processed using the keys. And, the element corresponding to that key is stored in the index. This process is called hashing.

# Techniques we can use in hashing:
1. Collision resolution by chaining
2. Open Addressing

## Open Addressing
1. Linear
2. Double Hashing
3. Quadratic 

# Good Hash Functions
1. Division Method
2. Multiplication Method
3. Universal Hashing

# Using Javascript in hash

## Using the Object Data Type:The simplest implementation is using the Object data type. This is because all non-scalar objects in JavaScript behave as associative arrays, a mapping from property keys to values. So an Object itself can behave as a basic hash table.

## Using a Map Object:The Map object was created to implement this type of associative array without some of the downsides of using a basic Object
