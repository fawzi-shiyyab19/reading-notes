Q1- What's the difference between PUT and PATCH?

| PUT | PATCH |
| --- | ----------- |
|PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource| PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data. |
| In a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced | With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version.|
| HTTP PUT is said to be idempotent, So if you send retry a request multiple times, that should be equivalent to a single request modification |  HTTP PATCH is basically said to be non-idempotent. So if you retry the request N times, you will end up having N resources with N different URIs created on the server.|
|It has High Bandwidth | Since Only data that need to be modified if send in the request body as a payload , It has Low Bandwidth  |

Q3- Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
apiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code.
It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.
js and apiproject.js as a html-page;Swagger Inspector: Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based
API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.

Q4- Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST?
Many legacy systems may still adhere to SOAP, while REST came later and is often viewed as a faster alternative in web-based scenarios. REST is a set of guidelines that offers flexible implementation, whereas SOAP is a protocol with specific requirements like XML messaging.
REST APIs are lightweight, making them ideal for newer contexts like the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile application development, and serverless computing. SOAP web services offer built-in security and transaction compliance that align with many enterprise needs, but that also makes them heavier. Additionally, many public APIs, like the Google Maps API, follow the REST guidelines.
