# Graph
## A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

# Types of Graphs:
1. Finite Graphs
2. Infinite Graph
3. Trivial Graph
4. Simple Graph 
5. Cyclic Graph
6. Connected or Disconnected Graph
7. Subgraph
8. Digraph Graph
9. Labeled Graph
10. Bipartite Graph
11. Regular Graph
12. Pseudo Graph
13. Complete Graph
14. Null Graph
15. Multi Graph

# Basic Properties of a Graph

## Distance between two Vertices: It is basically the number of edges that are available in the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B.If there is more than one edge which is used to connect two vertices then we basically considered the shortest path as the distance between these two vertices.

# Difference between graph and tree
## graph
1. Graph is a non-linear data structure. 
2. It is a collection of vertices/nodes and edges.
3. Each node can have any number of edges.
4. There is no unique node called root in graph.
5. A cycle can be formed.
6. For graph traversal, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS)

## tree
1. Tree is a non-linear data structure.
2. It is a collection of nodes and edges.
3. If there is n nodes then there would be n-1 number of edges
4. They are always directed
5. There is a unique node called root(parent) node in trees.
6. There will not be any cycle.
7. We traverse a tree using in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal methods.
8. For game trees, decision trees, the tree is used.
