# Chakra UI 

# What is Chakra UI:
## Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

# Is Chakra UI better than material UI?
## Chakra UI is a more robust, layout-focused library that also provides developers with UI components similar to those that Material UI provides, but has a greater focus on the creation of flexible, composable, and scalable code. A core concept to be considered when comparing the two frameworks is 'Ease of Modification'.
