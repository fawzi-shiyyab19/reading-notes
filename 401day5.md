## Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

## Socket.IO is NOT a WebSocket implementation.

## Socket.IO is not meant to be used in a background service for mobile applications.

## The io method is bound to the global scope in the standalone build:

## The Server instance (often called io in the code examples) has a few attributes that may be of use in your application. It also inherits all the methods of the main namespace, like namespace.use() (see here) or namespace.allSockets().

## The OSI model is a conceptual framework that is used to describe how a network functions. In plain English, the OSI model helped standardize the way computer systems send information to each other.
