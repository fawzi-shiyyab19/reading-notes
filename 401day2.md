# SQL database, ORM, Sequelize
#### What is SQL ?
<pre>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases
and perform various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s. </pre>

### SQL Command Types :
<ul>
  
<li>Data Definition Language (DDL) commands : are also called data definition commands because they are used to define data tables.</li>
<li>Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands : are used to manipulate data in existing tables by adding, changing or removing data. Unlike DDL commands that define how data is stored, DML commands operate in the tables defined with DDL commands.</li>
<li>Data Query Language : consists of just one command, SELECT, used to get specific data from tables. This command is sometimes grouped with the DML commands.</li>
<li>Data Control Language commands : are used to grant or revoke user access privileges.</li>
<li>Transaction Control Language commands : are used to change the state of some data -- for example, to COMMIT transaction changes or to ROLLBACK transaction changes.</li>
</ul>
## What's the difference between SQL  and NoSQL?
Type â€“ SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

## What is Sequlize and how to use it with Node js?

Sequelize is a modern TypeScript and Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and SQL Server, and more. Featuring solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

## What is an ORM, how does it work, and how should I use one?

Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique in which a metadata descriptor is used to connect object code to a relational database. Object code is written in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Java or C#. ORM converts data between type systems that are unable to coexist within relational databases and OOP languages.

**WRRC** : The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

**A database schema** : represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database.

**NoSQL databases** are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.
