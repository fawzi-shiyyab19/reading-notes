# Fundamentals of redux :
## how to manage state in your React application with Redux.
## It's also one of the hardest aspects of a modern front-end application to get right.
## Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.


## The whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store. The only way to change the state tree is to create an action, an object describing what happened, and dispatch it to the store. To specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure reducer functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.

import { createStore } from 'redux'
function counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'counter/incremented':
      return { value: state.value + 1 }
    case 'counter/decremented':
      return { value: state.value - 1 }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
let store = createStore(counterReducer)

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })


# Before we dive into some actual code, let's talk about some of the terms and concepts you'll need to know to use Redux.
## Let's start by looking at a small React counter component. It tracks a number in component state, and increments the number when a button is clicked:
function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  const increment = () => {
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Value: {counter} <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}

## State Managment
1. The state, the source of truth that drives our app;
2. The view, a declarative description of the UI based on the current state
3. The actions, the events that occur in the app based on user input, and trigger updates in the state

-------------

## one-way data flow
1. State describes the condition of the app at a specific point in time
2. The UI is rendered based on that state
3. When something happens (such as a user clicking a button), the state is updated based on what occurred
4. The UI re-renders based on the new state
